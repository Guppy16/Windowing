# Windowing
CUED IB Integrated Coursework

# ToDo
- [x] Plot DFT of an example mat file
- [ ] Plot a signal that is results in a bad FFT
    - [This article](https://www.edn.com/the-practicing-instrumentation-engineers-guide-to-the-dft-part-2-spectral-leakage-and-windowing/) gives an example of when to use the window. We could try and replicate this as a start
- [ ] Which windows shd we explore?
- [ ] Investigate window overlapping

# Deliverables
- [ ] Purpose of windowing (i.e. when it might be used)
    - Check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function)
- [ ] Factors to consider when windowing
- [ ] Research different types of windowing
    - [ ] How signal propoerties affect choice of window
        - [ ] Window type for short lab
        - [ ] Window type for real earthquake data **(need to find the earthquake data on moodle)**
- [ ] Either of:
    - [ ] Design and conduct an experiment to test the effect of various types of windowing function (isn't this already done by doing the above research?)
    - [ ] Investigate and test the effect of window overlapping. What are the optimum amounts of overlap required for various signals and windows?
